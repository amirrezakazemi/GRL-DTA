# Drug-Target Affinity Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting drug-target affinity using a graph neural network (GCN) model. The model processes chemical structures of drugs and protein sequences of targets to make predictions.

## Introduction

This project aims to predict drug-target affinity using a Graph Neural Network (GCN) model. The model takes as input the chemical structure of a drug and the protein sequence of a target and outputs a prediction of the affinity between them. The project consists of the following main components:

- `data_prep.py`: Contains data preprocessing functions and a custom dataset class for loading and processing the dataset.
- `model.py`: Defines the GCN model architecture using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning.
- `train.py`: Implements hyperparameter tuning using the Optuna library and trains the GCN model.

## Getting Started
`To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GRL-DTA.git
   cd GRL-DTA `

2.  Install the required packages using Pipenv. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

    `pipenv install`

    This will create a virtual environment and install all the necessary Python dependencies listed in the `Pipfile.lock` file.

3.  Activate the virtual environment:
